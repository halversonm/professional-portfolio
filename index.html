                    Hey! My name is Max, and I am currently enrolled in a full stack development boot camp 
                    through the University of Minnesota. I am 24 years old, and graduated from the University of 
                    Minnesota - Twin Cities with a B.S. in neuroscience. My professional experience includes
                    four years of work as an EMT, two of which were on an ambulance for M Health Fairview. I also 
                    have coached youth and high school boys lacrosse for the Centennial School District for 
                    four seasons. Hobbies of mine include playing sports, going out with friends, playing video games,
                    working out, playing guitar, and spending time with family. <br><br>

                    I am newer to the world of coding. As a child and into my high school years I had intentions 
                    of pursuing a career in medicine. After working in medicine throughout college for a few years,
                    I came to the conclusion that a medical career might not be the best fit for me after all. It 
                    didn't take long for me to come across coding and fall in love. I feel that my passion for learning
                    fits so well in this field because the sky is the limit for what you can learn to create. I'm  
                    beyond excited to continue this journey, and will keep this portfolio updated with my new and best projects as I 
                    complete them.
