                Hey! My name is Max, and I am currently enrolled in a full stack development boot camp 
                through the University of Minnesota. I am 24 years old, and graduated from the University of 
                Minnesota - Twin Cities with a B.S. in neuroscience. My professional experience includes
                four years of work as an EMT, two of which were on an ambulance for M Health Fairview. I also 
                have coached youth and high school boys lacrosse for the Centennial School District for 
                four seasons. Hobbies of mine include playing sports, going out with friends, playing video games,
                working out, playing guitar, and spending time with family.
            </p>
